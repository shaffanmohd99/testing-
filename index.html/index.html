        <h2> <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em> </h2>
        <p>Yes, I am coauthor of Introduction to Algorithms, along with <a href="http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/~cel">Charles Leiserson</a>, <a href="http://theory.csail.mit.edu/~rivest">Ron Rivest</a>, and <a href="http://www.ieor.columbia.edu/~cs2035">Cliff Stein</a> . For MIT Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/1990-introduction-algorithms">the secret to writing a best-selling textbook</a> .</p>
        <p>Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em> :</p>

        <dl>
            <dt><em>Will there be a fourth edition? If so, when will it be available?</em></dt>
            <dd>The fourth edition was released on 5 April 2022. The <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-fourth-edition">MIT Press site for the book</a> has links to sites that sell it.</dd>
            
            <br>
            <dt><em>Where can I find a list of errata?</em></dt>
            <dd>For the fourth edition, we maintain an <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/e4-bugs.html">errata page</a> that allows you to list errors by date, by page, or by severity.</dd>
            <br>
            <dd>For the second and third editions, we maintained an <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/e4-bugs.html">errata page</a> that allows you to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer. There is even an incremental update feature, allowing you to list only the errors posted since the last date that you asked about. We stopped logging errors for the third edition in January 2019 so that we could focus on preparing the fourth edition.</dd>
